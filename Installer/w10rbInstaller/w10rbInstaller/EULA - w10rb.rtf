\b Transparency. \b0 This SOFTWARE was primarily designed to address and patch a vulnerability bug in the Windows 10 operating system after the original manufacturer refused to apply a fix to the bug. Note that {\lang9{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK www.dennisbabkin.com }}{\fldrslt{www.dennisbabkin.com\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs16  supplies the SOFTWARE with the accompanying source code to provide transparency for the user. Since the SOFTWARE is injected as a component of the Windows 10 operating system, in place of a missing system module, {\lang9{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK www.dennisbabkin.com }}{\fldrslt{www.dennisbabkin.com\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs16   chose to provide the code of the injected component in an open form and available for a review. {\lang9{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK www.dennisbabkin.com }}{\fldrslt{www.dennisbabkin.com\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs16  will also provide several accompanying blog posts to describe the vulnerability in further details and to show-case what was done in the SOFTWARE. Please refer to: {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK https://dennisbabkin.com/blog }}{\fldrslt{https://dennisbabkin.com/blog\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs16\par
\b Merchentability. \b0 Due to the fact that the SOFTWARE relies on an unpatched Windows 10 operating system component, should the original manufacturer decide to fix (or patch) their product, the SOFTWARE may stop working in the form that it was originally advertised.\lang9\line\line\line\b 5. NO WARRANTY\line\line\b0 The {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK www.dennisbabkin.com }}{\fldrslt{www.dennisbabkin.com\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs16  expressly disclaims any warranty for the SOFTWARE.
